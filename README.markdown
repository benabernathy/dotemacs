Ben Abernathy's .emacs
======================

This is my dot emacs file plus all supporting files for your viewing pleasure. Most of this stuff I did not write myself (save for some of the helper defuns). Please respect the license of each thirdparty lib. I am by no means an emacs or elisp guru. If you have any questions/comments, then please let me know.
